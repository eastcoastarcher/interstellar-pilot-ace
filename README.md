# Interstellar Pilot2: A.C.E

## Archers Custom Edition

This edition of Interstealler Pilot 2 is a personl mod edition.

This mod is a bit more closer to the original stock game-play and feel, however with less micro-managing each ship detail for more fun game-play.

Some game play featuers:
- Updated graphics (same as contiuum)
- New sound track (same as continuum)
- Infinite Generators and capacitors
- Every shp has unique maxxed out engines and shielding
- Photon Bursts are the Anti-Fighter weapons, does direct-point shield damage
- Plasma Pulse is most powerful but slow, does half-splash shield damage
- Lasers do great against shields but have a high miss rate, does full-splash shield damage
- Mines and Missiles do more powerful damage

Enjoy.
